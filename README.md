# Feistel Cipher Implementation

Welcome to the Feistel Cipher Implementation repository. This codebase is a Python implementation of the Feistel cipher, a symmetric structure used in block cipher algorithms, which is notable for its use in many encryption technologies.

## What is Feistel Cipher?
The Feistel cipher is a structure used within many symmetric key algorithms. It is named after Horst Feistel and has the advantage of being easy to implement, whether in software or hardware, while also being robust and secure.

## How Does it Work?
This project provides an educational look into the workings of the Feistel cipher. It includes functions for encryption and decryption, allowing users to perform Feistel cipher operations on data. It showcases the transformation of input data through multiple rounds of processing to achieve secure encryption that can be reversed only with the correct key.
